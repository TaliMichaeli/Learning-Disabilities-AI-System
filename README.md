# Learning Disabilities AI System

A college project developed as part of the *"Software Requirements and Design Engineering"* course at Afeka College of Engineering.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing an AI-based system for the **early detection and personalized treatment of learning disabilities**, including:
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Dyslexia
- Dysgraphia

The system combines multiple sensing and AI technologies to analyze data from **EEG signals**, **eye-tracking**, **handwriting**, and **smartwatch-based learning interfaces**.  
It demonstrates a complete **requirements engineering process** — from research and system specification to architectural design and component integration.

## 🧠 System Components
- **Smart Autism Watch** – A smartwatch-based learning model that adapts tasks and tracks progress for children with ASD.  
- **EEG-Based ADHD Detection** – Uses ConvLSTM + Attention mechanisms to classify EEG data into ADHD or Healthy patterns.  
- **Eye-Tracking Dyslexia Detection** – Employs CNN + Transformer networks on rasterized gaze heatmaps for accurate dyslexia classification.  
- **Handwriting Analysis for Dysgraphia** – Uses RNN-LSTM autoencoder architecture with geometric feature extraction to detect handwriting irregularities.
